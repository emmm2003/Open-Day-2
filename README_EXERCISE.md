## Assignment

You have been assigned to support the Student Recruitment team in enhancing the Open Day website. The current site integrates a comprehensive [data feed](https://cardiffuniversityuitgb.github.io/CUOpenDayTest/api/OpenDay.json) that provides detailed information about the Open Day programme. However, the existing user experience is minimal and lacks many of the features and design elements typically expected from a modern, user-friendly event platform.

The goal of this project is to significantly improve the website’s usability, accessibility, and visual appeal, ensuring it effectively supports prospective students in planning and navigating their Open Day experience.

To complete the assignment, you should:
* Document the assignment requirements.
* Implement the requirements you have identified by modifying the provided repository.

### Client Brief

We are seeking to enhance the [Open Day website](https://cardiffuniversityuitgb.github.io/CUOpenDayTest/) to create a more engaging, accessible, and visually appealing experience for prospective students. The project will involve applying Cardiff University branding, enhancing the user interface and implementing a modern, responsive layout.
